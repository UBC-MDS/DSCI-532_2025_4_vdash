# Reflection for Milestone 4

## Additional Implementation/Refinement Since Milestone 3

- Originally, our dashboard had overlapping issues on narrow screens. Based on peer review feedback, we fixed the layout by setting the width of all charts to "container" to make them more responsive and prevent squishing, enhancing readability.
- Added a favicon and tab title to the dashboard, and adjusted the icon position in the header to better align with the original sketch.
- Updated currency switch logic to use `ctx` instead of number of clicks, making it more reliable and responsive after multiple clicks.

## Differences from Proposal/Sketch

- Same as milestone 2 and 3, no updates.

## Known Issues and Corner Cases

- The gauges are not set to "container" width, as we found it challenging to adjust the text font size responsively. Hence, they may not be fully responsive, but they should still display properly on most screens.
