## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios
Sophia is a Product Manager at a global automotive manufacturer. She is responsible for guiding the development of new car models, ensuring they meet market demand, and optimizing pricing strategies to stay competitive in a rapidly changing automotive landscape. Her main goals are to [analyze] how their vehicles compare in price, performance, and fuel efficiency with those of their competitors, [explore] on what features (horsepower, speed, fuel type) consumers value most, and [compare] their products against others in the industry to identify areas of improvement.

When Sophia opens the “Car Performance Dashboard”, she sees a comprehensive view of price distribution, horsepower, and speed across different vehicle types, fuel types, and competing brands. Sophia uses the dashboard to [filter] the data by company, fuel type (electric, hybrid, gasoline), and vehicle category (e.g., SUVs, sedans, sports cars) to analyze how her company’s cars compare with others. By exploring the price distribution and performance of hybrid vehicles, Sophia notices that her company’s hybrid vehicle is priced higher than some competitors but has superior horsepower and speed. This could be a strong selling point for premium consumers who value both performance and sustainability. Based on this insight, Sophia decides to push marketing efforts that emphasize the high performance and environmental benefits of their hybrid cars.

Next, Sophia comapres the performance of their mid-range sedans compared to competitors. She notices that while their vehicles are priced competitively, their horsepower lags behind certain competitors’ models, which may be a turn-off for performance-conscious buyers. This prompts her to request a review of engineering priorities for future iterations of this model to boost its horsepower while keeping costs within the target price range.

Using the [filter] and [compare] features, Sophia is able to identify which models in the same category are offering more horsepower or better speed for a similar price. She might decide to recommend slight price adjustments to her sales team or collaborate with engineering to improve certain performance attributes to ensure their vehicles offer the best value for their customers.
