## Car Price Distribution Boxplot
The Car Price Distribution Boxplot provides an interactive visualization of how car prices vary across different categories. Users can select different grouping categories, such as company names or fuel types, to compare price distributions dynamically. The boxplot includes tooltips that display detailed statistical summary, including minimum price, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum price. It can help users understand the spread and concentration of prices within each category.  In the sidebar, there's an interactive price range selection, which includes both a slider and manual input fields. Those two components are synchronized to ensure the precise selection experience. The boxplot is responsive to currency selection as well, so that users can switch between CAD and USD, and the visualization updates accordingly. A key limitation in the current implementation of the price range slider is that the upper bound does not update the boxplot when sliding from right to left (decreasing the max price). Instead, the visualization only responds when moving the upper bound from left to right (increasing the max price).
